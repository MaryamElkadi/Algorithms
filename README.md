The Divide and Conquer algorithm is a powerful technique used in computer science for solving problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems, solving the subproblems independently, and then combining their results to obtain the solution to the original problem.

This project demonstrates how the Divide and Conquer approach can be applied to different problems. The implementation includes various algorithms, each showcasing the divide and conquer strategy.

Divide and Conquer Technique: The main principle of divide and conquer is to divide the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems, solve them individually, and then combine the results to get the final solution.

Recursive Approach: The divide and conquer algorithms typically make use of recursion to break down the problem until it reaches a base case, after which the solution is built up as the recursion unwinds.

Efficiency: Many divide and conquer algorithms improve efficiency by breaking problems into smaller pieces that can be solved in parallel or in a more optimized manner.

Algorithms Implemented:

Merge Sort: A sorting algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and merges them back together.
Quick Sort: A sorting algorithm that picks a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.
Binary Search: A search algorithm that divides the sorted array in half, compares the middle element with the target, and recursively searches in the appropriate half.
Strassen's Matrix Multiplication: An optimized algorithm for multiplying matrices using divide and conquer.
